Additions that were made included an admin/trainee system, adding statuses to profiles on the site (this included email notifications after a change of status), and the ability to share profiles publicly to users without accounts.<br></figcaption>

      <p>While studying at university I had multiple opportunities to improve my general skills such as a team project in my second year of study which helped test/improve my teamwork skills, In my third year of study I completed a individual project; both of these were successful and were great learning experiences dependant on time management, flexibility, problem solving and planning. Both of these projects also had supervisors and documentation to be completed giving me a greater idea of how these type of projects would work in the real world.</p>
      <h2>Final Year Project</h2>

           My initial idea for this project I had to do in my final year was to focus on concepts I learnt in Information and the Web and Networks modules. The title of the project I settled on was Implementation of a hidden functionality in a web page; my goal for this project was to create a website where someone could access some hidden sensitive information only if they knew some key while someone who didn't know the key would be unaware of any hidden information. For this project I produced a basic website(not my best), a server, and some hidden key that could be used within the website.<br> <a href="reportfyp.pdf" download>Download Report</a>

          The initial brief for this project was to create a piece of software for teaching an aspect of computer science. After some discussion amongst the team we decided to cover sorting algorithms and target our teaching software at first year computer science students. After we completed the teaching section, we added a section for people to login and take tests on what was covered. A screenshot of the completed software can be seen to the left.<br><a href="reporttp.pdf" download>Download Report</a>
